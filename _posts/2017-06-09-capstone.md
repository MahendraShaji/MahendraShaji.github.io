In Retail Industry and chain of stores one of the biggest problem they face are supply chain management. The component of supply chain management (SCM) involved with determining how best to fulfil the requirements created from the Demand Plan. Its objective is to balance supply and demand in a manner that achieves the financial and service objectives of the enterprise.

  If we look into the case of a retail chain stores one of the basic case is to know the demand of products that are sold in the store. If the decision making authority know what the demand of each products is for a week or month, they would be able to plan the supply chain accordingly. If that is possible this would save a lot of money for them because they don't have to overstock or can plan their Logistics and staffing accordingly.
   

### Objective

To create a model to predict the weekly sales for a chain of stores by analysing the trends of sales over time and the economic features.
 
### Data

To start this project I am using a dataset from Kaggle.com. I would be doing my analysis and study on a dataset that gives me the weekly sales data of Walmart.

There are 3 Datasets 
1. Weekly Sales data of 98 departments in 45 stores,
primary key is a combination of (Store, Dept, Date).
2. The Features dataset with economic details like CPI, Unemployment rate, Fuel price etc.. For each week in the region of the Store
primary key here is a combination of (Store, Date)
3. In the third dataset I have area of each store and Type
primary key is Store

### Method

 I am breaking this problem into 2 stages

    1. Create a predictive model that predicts the weekly sales of 45
       Stores (In this stage I am not planning to predict the sales on 
	 Department Level)

    2. Extend the project to Department Level (Future Work)
    
 I have done basic cleaning of the data I have and did some basic exploratory data analysis. From the insights I have got from the analysis I have further moved to creating models and fine tuning of models. I have used different type of Regression Models and Times Series Analysis to proceed and solve this stage.
 
#### List of Models
     1. Lasso Regression
     2. Random Forest Regression
     3. Support Vector Regression
     4. Time Series Analysis
 
### Conclusion

 I have come up with different models that have helped me to predict the weekly sales of 45 stores with around 94% of accuracy for 3 months(90 Days). Out of the models I ran, I selected the Lasso Regression as my predictive Model since it gave me the high accuracy of prediction with the lowest residual (error). 

 Even though I have selected one model as of now I am trying to predict sales for 45 stores. I am sure the impact of each feature might be different for different stores because of many reasons and thats why I checked how different my prediction with each store is.

Here the bigger the bubble is the higher the variation in prediction. So we can see that there are 3 stores which have more than 5% variation in prediction. In the future study I can look into these store and try to see what goes wrong and using an ensemble method of getting prediction from different models try to improve the predictions
